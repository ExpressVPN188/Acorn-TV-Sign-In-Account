 Protecting Your Account
 It is critical that you maintain the security of your Acorn TV sign-in account since it contains your subscription information and watching preferences.  Create a complex password using a combination of letters, numbers, and various symbols.  Keep your passwords unique across all of your platforms.

 Be wary of emails that seem to be from Acorn TV or any other questionable source, and never give out your password to anyone.  Their verified domains are the only ones that will be able to send official messages.  Never enter your credentials through an unofficial link or pop-up; instead, use the official website or app.
